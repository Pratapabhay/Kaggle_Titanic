# Feature Engineering
## What's in a name?

# Grab title from passenger names
full$Title <- gsub('(.*, )|(\\..*)', '', full$Name)

# Show title counts by sex
table(full$Sex, full$Title)

# Titles with very low cell counts to be combined to "rare" level
rare_title <- c('Dona', 'Lady', 'the Countess','Capt', 'Col', 'Don', 
'Dr', 'Major', 'Rev', 'Sir', 'Jonkheer')

# Also reassign mlle, ms, and mme accordingly
full$Title[full$Title == 'Mlle']        <- 'Miss' 
full$Title[full$Title == 'Ms']          <- 'Miss'
full$Title[full$Title == 'Mme']         <- 'Mrs' 
full$Title[full$Title %in% rare_title]  <- 'Rare Title'

# Show title counts by sex again
table(full$Sex, full$Title)

# Finally, grab surname from passenger name
full$Surname <- sapply(full$Name,  
function(x) strsplit(x, split = '[,.]')[[1]][1])

# Create a family size variable including the passenger themselves
full$Fsize <- full$SibSp + full$Parch + 1

# Create a family variable 
full$Family <- paste(full$Surname, full$Fsize, sep='_')

# Use ggplot2 to visualize the relationship between family size & survival
ggplot(full[1:891,], aes(x = Fsize, fill = factor(Survived))) +
  geom_bar(stat='count', position='dodge') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1:11)) +
  labs(x = 'Family Size') +
  theme_few()

full$FsizeD[full$Fsize == 1] <- 'singleton'
full$FsizeD[full$Fsize < 5 & full$Fsize > 1] <- 'small'
full$FsizeD[full$Fsize > 4] <- 'large'


full$Cabin[1:28]

# The first character is the deck. For example:
strsplit(full$Cabin[2], NULL)[[1]]

# Create a Deck variable. Get passenger deck A - F:
full$Deck<-factor(sapply(full$Cabin, function(x) strsplit(x, NULL)[[1]][1]))

# Passengers 62 and 830 are missing Embarkment
full[c(62, 830), 'Embarked']

# Get rid of our missing passenger IDs
embark_fare <- full %>%
  filter(PassengerId != 62 & PassengerId != 830)

# Use ggplot2 to visualize embarkment, passenger class, & median fare
# Since their fare was $80 for 1st class, they most likely embarked from 'C'
full$Embarked[c(62, 830)] <- 'C'

full[1044, ]


#From this visualization, it seems quite reasonable to replace the NA Fare value with median for their class and embarkment which is $`r  median(full[full$Pclass == '3' & full$Embarked == 'S', ]$Fare, na.rm = TRUE)`.

# Replace missing fare value with median fare for class/embarkment
full$Fare[1044] <- median(full[full$Pclass == '3' & full$Embarked == 'S', ]$Fare, na.rm = TRUE)

## Predictive imputation


# Show number of missing Age values
sum(is.na(full$Age))


# Make variables factors into factors
factor_vars <- c('PassengerId','Pclass','Sex','Embarked', 'Title','Surname','Family','FsizeD')

full[factor_vars] <- lapply(full[factor_vars], function(x) as.factor(x))

# Set a random seed
set.seed(129)

# Perform mice imputation, excluding certain less-than-useful variables:
mice_mod <- mice(full[, !names(full) %in% c('PassengerId','Name','Ticket','Cabin','Family','Surname','Survived')], method='rf') 

# Save the complete output 
mice_output <- complete(mice_mod)

# Plot age distributions
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(full$Age, freq=F, main='Age: Original Data', 
     col='darkgreen', ylim=c(0,0.04))
hist(mice_output$Age, freq=F, main='Age: MICE Output', 
     col='lightgreen', ylim=c(0,0.04))



# Replace Age variable from the mice model.
full$Age <- mice_output$Age

# Show new number of missing Age values
sum(is.na(full$Age))


## Feature Engineering: Round 2


# First we'll look at the relationship between age & survival
ggplot(full[1:891,], aes(Age, fill = factor(Survived))) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  # I include Sex since we know (a priori) it's a significant predictor
  facet_grid(.~Sex) + 
  theme_few()

# Create the column child, and indicate whether child or adult
full$Child[full$Age < 18] <- 'Child'
full$Child[full$Age >= 18] <- 'Adult'

# Show counts
table(full$Child, full$Survived)


# Adding Mother variable
full$Mother <- 'Not Mother'
full$Mother[full$Sex == 'female' & full$Parch > 0 & full$Age > 18 & full$Title != 'Miss'] <- 'Mother'

# Show counts
table(full$Mother, full$Survived)

# Finish by factorizing our two new factor variables
full$Child  <- factor(full$Child)
full$Mother <- factor(full$Mother)


md.pattern(full)


# Split the data back into a train set and a test set
train <- full[1:891,]
test <- full[892:1309,]


m <- naiveBayes(as.factor(Survived) ~ Pclass + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch + 
                           Fare + Embarked + Title + 
                           FsizeD + Child + Mother, data = train)

my <- predict(m, as.data.frame(test)[,1:3])

Titanic_Naive_Bayes <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = my)
write.csv(Titanic_Naive_Bayes, file = "Titanic_Naive_Bayes.csv", row.names = FALSE)
